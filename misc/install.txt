Installation of webkitfolders

check PHP version 5.3

CENT:

rpm --import http://repo.webtatic.com/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-webtatic-andy
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
wget http://repo.webtatic.com/yum/webtatic.repo
yum --enablerepo=webtatic update php
yum --enablerepo=webtatic install php-devel






install PEAR modules:
	json

1. Install Kohana
-----------------

Grab a copy of Kohana (http://www.kohanaphp.com) - remove anything but the system folder
as the svn checkout will define the modules and the website
will define the application

The application is a skeleton config - all the action happens in the modules

Normally Kohana gets installed into /usr/local/kohana/system

You can put it whereever you want though



2. Checkout WebkitFolders from SVN
---------------------------------------------

Checkout the codebase from SVN and put it somewhere like:

/usr/local/webkitfolders

or

/home/webkit/sites/webkitfolders


3. Create the Admin Website
---------------------------

3.1 path_to_admin_site/www/kohana.php
-------------------------------------
You need to create the kohana.php in the root of the site that you 
want to use for the admin website.

The important parts of this are:

	$kohana_application -> points to the skeleton config of the admin site (see below)
	
		../application
	
	$kohana_modules -> points to the modules folder of the svn checkout
	
		/usr/local/webkitfolders/modules
	
	$kohana_system -> points to where the kohana system is installed (as above)
	
		/usr/local/kohana/system
	
3.2 path_to_admin_site/application/config
-----------------------------------------
This is the skeleton application that only really gives you a chance to configure
the webkit folders admin app - it does not define any code hence there only
being a config folder

	--------------------------------------------
	
	config/config.php
		This is the admin site Kohana config file
		
		Trigger URL (/app) - this MUST line up with the apache rewrite that you apply below
		
		In other words /app/* is what will get rewritten to kohana.php?$1
		
		Therefore - tell Kohana that /app is the base URL
		
		The important thing here is that it includes the folders modules like so:
		
		$config['modules'] = array
		(
			MODPATH.'webkitfoldersadmin',
			MODPATH.'webkitfolders'
		);
		
	--------------------------------------------
	
	config/webkitfolders.php
		The admin site webkit folders config - this lets you configure the various
		aspects of the admin site install - as the modules that are inSVN will be 
		overwritten if you do an update - if you need to override the defaults,
		configure them here - everything you can configure here is configured
		from within the modules config:
		
		icon_folder - where is the icons folder (i.e. the source icons) on the local
		system
		
			/usr/local/webkitfoldersicons
			
		icon_cache_folder - where is the folder that will be used to cache the icons
		on the local system
		
			/usr/local/webkitfolderscache/icons
		
		upload_folder - where is the folder that will be used to hold uploaded files
		on the local system
		
			/uploaded_files
			
		NOTE - uploaded files should be SYMLINKED from inside the site and will probably
		actually live here (see below for more about the symlinking):
		
			/usr/local/uploaded_files
			
		The icons don't need to be symlinked because they are all served from a controller
		TODO - uploaded files should be served from a controller so permissions can be applied
		and the files are not publically accessible
		
	--------------------------------------------
	
	config/database.php
		Kohana Database config for the admin site - this needs to be defined here because inevitably
		the DB details will be different when you put the site on a different server
		
	
3.3 httpd Rewrite Rule
-----------------------------------------	
You must create a rewrite rule for the httpd serving the admin site so that anything inside of /app 
(or your choosen path) will be rewritten to kohana.php

3.4 Symlink Ext application
---------------------------
next you need to symlink to the EXT application that lives in amoungst the SVN
it is up to you what folder you want the ext application to run in but this should be configured
in the config for the admin app (admin_application_folder)

ln -s /usr/local/webkitfolders/admin/extapplication adminApp

3.5 Install EXT
-----------------

Download and install EXT (http://www.extjs.com) into the admin website - install it into /ext

3.5 Install IUI
-----------------

Download and install IUI (http://code.google.com/p/iui/downloads/list) into the admin website - install it into /iui


4. Create folders
-----------------
Create folders for the ICONS and CACHE and UPLOADS

Icons - the folder that contains all of the icons must be moved somewhere and then configured in webkitfolders.php

Cache - the folder that will be used for the file cache - configured in webkitfolders.php
Note - you don't need to create a icons subfolder - it will do this automatically

Uploads - the folder used to upload files into - again configure in webkitfolders.php

5. Install ImageMagick
----------------------

RPM World
yum install libjpeg-devel libpng-devel glib2-devel fontconfig-devel zlib-devel libwmf-devel freetype-devel libtiff-devel

APT-GET World

apt-get install libjpeg62-dev
apt-get install libbz2-dev
apt-get install libtiff4-dev
apt-get install libwmf-dev
apt-get install zlib1g-dev
apt-get install liblcms1-dev
apt-get install libexif-dev
apt-get install libperl-dev


then compile ImageMagick from source

then go and grab imagick + magickwand module from PECL

unzip it and cd into folder

phpize
./configure
make

now we have built the module - move it to the PHP modules folder

cd modules
/usr/lib/php/modules/ (or extension_dir in phpinfo())

then add to PHP configuration (/etc/php.d/) or (/etc/php5/conf.d/)
