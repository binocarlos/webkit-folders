changelog - 21-10-2009
		
Ext App

- 	fixed the folderDataView so the drag area expands to fill the content area

- 	added TabPanel to folderView so it can display multiple views for one folder

- 	changed the menu layout - created top level menu and added icons to menu buttons

- 	changed the treeIcon CSS mechanism by dynamically creating the icon CSS on demand 
	rather than the server request
	
Kohana App

-	made schema.php into a proper model without all the static methods

-	created a simpleORM model that does ORM without all the hassle : )

-	changed the Item model into a simpleORM and created Keyword Model

-	streamlined the Query_Model so it loads up Item Models by default and interrogates the schema properly
		-	changed the Query_Model language to:
		
				select 	[what types of item]
				from	[the location to load from]
				where	[the clause to match items against]
				
		-	this is getting ready for when items have true paths (e.g. /products/furniture)
			and you can say something like
			
				select products
				from /products/furniture

-	started to change the way the system asks for items so everything goes through the Query_Model
		- 	for example - in the admin/item_controller - to ask for an items children before it would load the data manually
			now it issues a select * from $id statement to the Query_Model and it looks after it
