For extracting images from a video:

ffmpeg -i foo.avi -r 1 -s WxH -f image2 foo-%03d.jpeg

This will extract one video frame per second from the video and will output them in files named `foo-001.jpeg', `foo-002.jpeg', etc. Images will be rescaled to fit the new WxH values.

If you want to extract just a limited number of frames, you can use the above command in combination with the -vframes or -t option, or in combination with -ss to start extracting from a certain point in time.

 

 

 

Here's the code to get the width and height.

<?php

// get video width and height
// Will - 10-14-07
// for testing call with: ffmpeg_image.php?file=video.flv

$videofile = (isset($_GET['file'])) ? strval($_GET['file']) : 'video.flv';

ob_start();
passthru("ffmpeg-10141.exe -i \"". $videofile . "\" 2>&1");
$size = ob_get_contents();
ob_end_clean();

preg_match('/(\d{2,4})x(\d{2,4})/', $size, $matches);
$width = $matches[1];
$height = $matches[2];

print "  Size: " . $size   . "<br />\n";
print " Width: " . $width  . "<br />\n";
print "Height: " . $height . "<br />\n";

?>


You only need the code from ob_start(); to $height = $matches[2]; The rest is just for testing. Assign your filename to $videofile.

You should get output that looks like this:
